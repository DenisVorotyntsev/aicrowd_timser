# Description 

Ability to predict the future can be really valuable.
But since we donâ€™t have Doc and his DeLorean time machine from Back to the Future, 
we have to rely on other means to know the future. Using time-series prediction can you 
find the future of these synthetic stock prices. Given the prices of the stock for the past, 
predict its value in the future.
